# Weather App Rebuild

This is a revamp of my Weather App built with React,js, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. I first built this in Javascript, then again in React.js, and now once more but enhanced with TypeScript and further modifications. The application allows users to search for weather information about different locations and provides them with the current temperature, high and low temperatures for the day, as well as a 5-day forecast. The project utilizes the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data and displays images related to the weather conditions. As well as a favorites page to manage favorite locations.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory
3. Obtain an API key from OpenWeather by signing up on their website (https://openweathermap.org/guide)
4. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project
5. In the `.env` file, add the following line and replace `YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeather API key: REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
6. Start the development server by running `npm start`
7. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the site

> **Note:** Make sure to keep your API key confidential and do not commit the `.env` file to any public repositories. The `.env` file is already added to the `.gitignore`, so it won't be uploaded to the repository.
